# Auth

## Build

The application can be built using the following command:

```
mvnw clean package
```

Start your application with the following command - here with the profile `production`:

```
java -Dspring.profiles.active=production -jar ./target/auth-0.0.1-SNAPSHOT.jar
```

If required, a Docker image can be created with the Spring Boot plugin. Add `SPRING_PROFILES_ACTIVE=production` as environment variable when running the container.

```
mvnw spring-boot:build-image -Dspring-boot.build-image.imageName=com.ominimie/auth
```
